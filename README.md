# ssc-comment-navigation
A userscript that adds navigation buttons to comments on [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/).

## Purpose

When reading comments on SSC (in particular the open threads), I often find
myself wanting to skip an entire subthread that has taken a direction that
I am not interested in. This often involves a lot of scrolling (in particular
on handheld devices) and a good chance to accidently miss the end of the
subthread, also scrolling past the next one.

This userscript adds two navigation buttons to each comment on Slate Star Codes:
one to jump to the parent of the comment and one to skip the subthread starting
at this comment.

## Prerequisites

Install a userscript manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)
or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).

## Installation

Open the [raw userscript file](https://github.com/deffi/ssc-comment-navigation/raw/master/ssc-comment-navigation.user.js)
from this repository. The userscript manager should offer to install the script.
